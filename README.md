# Player_Picker_Pro

This project originated as a class project with the intention of building a website from scratch with the ability to host a database built from several distinct public datasets that would allow for basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functions. The content was chosen mostly because of availability of many large open data sources to ensure that the final site would be able to demonstrate ability to work with large data. The site is built using Flask with Bootstrap theming and a SQLite database. For information on how the database was compiled see the repo https://github.com/pvstewar/Soccer_stat_database.
